How to print an HashMap in Swing?

First of all sorry for my english. I'm trying to build a program that gets inputs from the user by JOptionPane.showInputDialog() and store it in an HashMap<String, Integer>.

I did it and it works.

But the problem is that i want to print all the HashMap keys and values in a swing component (JList or JTable or something else) but i don't know wich is better and simple to use. Wich do you suggest?
